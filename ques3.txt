The function sumOfValue(int len, int *arr, int value) adds up all the numbers of the entered array, which are completely divisible by the entered value,
For example – If the entered array is arr{1,2,3,4,5}, and the entered value is 2, then the output will be 2+4 = 6.
The function sumOfValue(int len, int *arr, int value) accepts three inputs, that are – len which represents the length of the array, arr[] which represents the array of numbers and value which represents the value that will be entered by the user.
The function sumOfValue(int len, int *arr, int value) compiles successfully but fails to get the desired results for some test cases due to logical errors. Your task is to fix the code, so that it passes all the test cases
int sumOfValue(int len, int* arr, int value)
{
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i =1 ; i <= len; i++   )
    {
        if(arr[i]%value == 0) 
            sum =+ arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

Python:
def sumOfValue(len, arr, value):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, len+1):
        if arr[i] % value == 0:
         sum = +arr[i]
    return sum
